# Bullets Come From The Muzzle - RE4 Remake Mod

## What Does This Mod Do?
==================================

Ever stuffed your barrel into a Ganado's eye socket and somehow when you fired, the bullet hit something behind him instead? That's because bullets actually spawn from the camera in RE4. This mod makes bullets travel from the muzzle of your gun to the reticle for a more natural and intuitive shooting experience.

Bullets will still travel to the reticle as they always have beyond about 2-3 yards (meters) relative distance in-game. Within this distance, bullets will progressively hit a little low and left the closer the target until your muzzle is touching the target, at which point the impact will be exactly at the muzzle as shown in the thumbnail/banner.

## How To Install?
==================================

1. **DO NOT EXTRACT** the file.
2. Give the `.rar` directly to **Fluffy Mod Manager**.
3. **Profit**!
